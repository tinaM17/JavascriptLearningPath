/***
 * Class:- Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
 * 
 * Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, a className can be defined in two ways: a className expression or a className declaration.
 * The body of a className is the part that is in curly braces {}. This is where you define className members, such as methods or constructor.

The body of a className is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

A className element can be characterized by three aspects:

Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field
Location: Static or instance
Visibility: Public or private

 * The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a className. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a className â€” a SyntaxError is thrown if the className contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.

//Creating a className
/** 
className User {
    constructor(username,password){
        this.username=username;
        this.password=password
    }
    // Constructor used for creating and initializing the object

    get getUsername(){
       return this.username
    }
    get getPassword(){
        return this.password
    }
    //The get syntax binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up. It can also be used in classes.
    set setUsername(username){
       this.username=username
    }
    set setPassword(password){
        this.password=password
    }
    // The set syntax binds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property.
    getDetails(){
        console.log(`${this.username} have the password ${this.password}`);
    }
    //Method definition is a shorter syntax for defining a function property in an object initializer.
}

// How to create an object?
const user=new User("Tina","1234")
console.log(user.getDetails());
console.log(user.getUsername);
console.log(user.getPassword);
user.setUsername="Misty"
console.log(user.getUsername);
console.log(user.getDetails());

/****
 * Inheritance:- Js gives us a new keyword "extends" that use to inherite one className prototype to another className.
 * It just a syntactic sugar but behind the scene it's implement the same prototypical inheritance

// So as we extends User in the Teacher className so we can access the method of user className also

const user2=new User("Misty")
console.log(user2.loggedIn());

//console.log(user2.addCourse());
//Gives an error because User className does not extends Teacher className means it does not have the prototype of Teacher so user can not invoke the methods of Teacher className

console.log(user1 instanceof Teacher); //true
console.log(user1 instanceof User);  //true
console.log(user2 instanceof Teacher); //false
